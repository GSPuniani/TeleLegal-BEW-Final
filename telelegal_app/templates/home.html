        <p>
            TeleLegal remotely and securely connects Attorneys to Potential Clients across the State of California. Attorneys utilizing TeleLegal’s services gain access to a pool of California citizens with specific and often urgent legal questions. Either the Attorney or a Potential Client can initiate a text chat with the other as part of the initial consultation. The Attorney and Potential Client can then agree to enter a video chat to further discuss the case particulars and complete the consultation. During or after this video call, the Attorney and Potential Client--if they decide to proceed forward with the matter--may exchange additional contact information and negotiate between themselves a reasonable fee agreement. Many “routine” services, such as drafting a simple will or reviewing a standard contract, may be offered at a flat rate. Attorneys who sign up will also have access to the TeleLegal Community, a forum for lawyers to share useful practice tips with each other.

                    With TeleLegal, attorneys of all experience levels have access to Potential Clients all over California. This is especially useful for newly instated attorneys who do not yet have an expansive network from which to establish their practice. However, more seasoned attorneys can also take advantage of TeleLegal's service to earn extra income by completing small cases or services on the side, branching out of their primary practice areas, or reaching clients who otherwise struggle with finding legal help.
